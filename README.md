# Online Car Rental System Project in Django with Source Code

The **Online Car Rental System project in Django** has three modules one for car dealers, one for clients, and one for the home page are among the three modules.

Models, URLS, and views are handled by each app in the usual Django way.

Moving on , the **Online Car Rental system works** as follows: a car dealer visits the car dealer portal, registers, and uploads cars that he believes are available for rental.

Anyway, customer logs into the customer portal, specifies the area in which he wants the car, and the system searches all available car-dealers and their vehicles in that area, displaying the results to the customer. If the car has already been rented.

However, the primary goal of this **Online Car Rental system** project was to learn the Django framework, handle backend tasks, and manage databases, no bootstrap or other CSS frameworks were used.

Also, I have used the local MYSQL database, and the python classes in models.py assisted in database management and upgrading.

The database configuration can be found in ocrs/ocrs/settings.py, where you can add your own database, username, and password in the DATABASE section.
